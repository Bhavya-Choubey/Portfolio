                Hi, I'm Bhavya Choubey. 
                Nice to meet you. Please take a
                look around.

                Following my completion of secondary education, I embarked on a journey to cultivate my passion for programming. 
                This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at VIT College, where I focused on Information Technology 
                to deepen my understanding of programming. Presently, I am in the 3rd year of my academic journey.
                What captivates me most about programming is the inherent problem-solving nature of the discipline. 
                There's an unparalleled sense of accomplishment when I unravel complex challenges and arrive at viable solutions. 
                As I stand on the cusp of transitioning into the professional world, I eagerly seek an opportunity to apply my 
                skills and knowledge as an intern.Beyond the realm of coding, I find joy in painting, dancing, 
                immersing myself in movies, and cherishing quality time with my family. 
                I possess an insatiable curiosity and relish the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills.
